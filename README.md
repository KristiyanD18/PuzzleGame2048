This 2048 Puzzle Game Application is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. It requests nickname and size of the grid from the player. The game's objective is to slide numbers with commands (w-up, a-left, s-down, d-right) on a grid to combine them to create the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal. Added features include beeping on every combination and color change as going closer to the goal.
